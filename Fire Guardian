"Fire Guardian" is a group project which is conducted in the
Electrical Measurement and Instrumentation module -
Semester 4 from the Department of Electrical Engineering,
University of Moratuwa. This is a fire-detecting and fireprevention system. This was a LabVIEW-based project and we
had to design one sensor and use other two more sensors
with proper actuators. We successfully designed and
implemented this system using Arduino Uno Board, ESP32,
and SIM900A GSM module.
We demonstrated this project at the "EXMO" exhibition which
is conducted by the University of Moratuwa.
